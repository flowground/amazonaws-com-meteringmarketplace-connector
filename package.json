    "description": "AWS Marketplace Metering Service This reference provides descriptions of the\nlow-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.\n\nAWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage\ndimensions.\n\n Submitting Metering Records \n\n *   MeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product.\n   MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance.\n   \n   \n *   BatchMeterUsage- Submits the metering record for a set of customers.\n   BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.\n   \n   \n\n Accepting New Customers \n\n *   ResolveCustomer- Called by a SaaS application during the registration\n   process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process,\n   the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration\n   Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product\n   Code.\n   \n   \n\n Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products \n\n *   Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must\n   integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the\n   RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Calling\n   RegisterUsage from containers running outside of Amazon Elastic Container\n   Service (Amazon ECR) isn't supported. Free and BYOL products for ECS aren't\n   required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive\n   usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the\n   RegisterUsage operation, see Container-Based Products\n   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/latest/userguide/entitlement-and-metering-for-paid-products.html]\n   . \n   \n   \n\nBatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail\nto verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching\nfor records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail\nto audit records over time. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User\nGuide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html] \n .",
